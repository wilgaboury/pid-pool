# PID Pool

This is a random idea that I quite literally thought of in the shower. It's the classic [object pool pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern) with a twist. The pool is dynamic but instead of having to set a hard size limit (which is usually just guess work and can often be hard to determine empirically), it uses control theory to dynamically change it's maximum size based on the number of objects currently in use. Ideally, this means that the pool will find the optimal speed to memory balance based on how it is being used at any given time.

In brief (and I am by no means an expert) a pid controller has a set point (the number of objects currently in use) and a process variable (the max size of our pool). The closed-loop control system calculates error and applies correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms. When the controller is tuned correctly it should put the system into an optimal state with minimal delay and overshoot.
